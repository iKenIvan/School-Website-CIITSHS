We created an industry-standard curriculum that incorporates hands-on learning in multimedia, animation, and programming, and equips students with information and abilities that they can apply even before entering college. Our Senior High School curriculum includes specialized areas that can be used to college credits, especially if a student chooses to continue their education at CIIT.</p>
            <p>All of our CIIT SHS graduates found it simple to continue their education at CIIT. They will be automatically accepted into our College programs. They won't have to go through the application process or prepare and submit any paperwork as a result. </p>
